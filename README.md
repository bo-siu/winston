## Legend
![Legend](./legend.png)

Winston provides 3 ways to access Internet:

* Normal Access.
* Shadowsocks Access (for chinese)
* Tor Access (Because tor is blocked in China, so it is necessary to use shadowsocks as a proxy for it)

## How to use
1. Configure shadowsocks (`config/shadowsocks/config.json`).
2. Install [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/).
3. Use dokcer-compose to run Winston.
4. Use localhost:8118 as your proxy.
5. Enjoy it.
