            DON'T BE A DICK PUBLIC LICENSE
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  Do whatever you like with the original work, just don't be a dick.
  Being a dick includes - but is not limited to - the following instances:

    1a. Outright copyright infringement - Don't just copy this and change the
        name.
    1b. Selling the unmodified original with no work done what-so-ever, that's
        REALLY being a dick.
    1c. Modifying the original work to contain hidden harmful content. That
        would make you a PROPER dick.

  If you become rich through modifications, related works/services, or
  supporting the original work, share the love. Only a dick would make loads off
  this work and not buy the original work's creator(s) a pint.

 Code is provided with no warranty. Using somebody else's code and bitching when
 it goes wrong makes you a DONKEY dick. Fix the problem yourself. A non-dick
 would submit the fix back.
